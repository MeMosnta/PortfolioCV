<h2>Advent of Code-</h2>

https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels 
that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

I have Provided my own solutions to the problems for each day, with the problem being commented on the python file, and specific input text file provided with the same name.


<h2>Java Maze Project (A-Level Computer Science Individual Project)</h2>

For my A-Level Computer Science Coursework, we had to create an individual project, which would solve a problem that already existed or one which we would create. So,
I decided to create an app which generated and solved mazes. This was very interesting to do and very fun, creating some very nice looking mazes whilst also teaching me
time and project management, as well as code commenting and conciseness to be able to continue developing day by day and week by week. Screenshots are from the Project
below.
